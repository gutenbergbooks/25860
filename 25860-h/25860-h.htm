<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span></p>

<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>A warrant has been issued for the arrest of Signor <span class="sc">Ulvi</span>, the inventor of
&ldquo;F&rdquo; rays. He is said to have eloped from Florence with an Admiral&#8217;s
daughter. This was not discovered until Signor <span class="sc">Ulvi</span> had got well away,
and his claim to be able to cause explosions at a distance would now
seem to be established.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>General <span class="sc">Huerta</span> is said to have taken with him on his flight securities
to the amount of £1,200,000. Even so it is typical of the grasping
nature of the man that he complained of having to leave Mexico City
behind.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A storm of indignation has been raised in Berlin by an order
(instigated, it is said, in a very high quarter) that all <i>cafés</i> must
close at 2 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> A petition is being circulated which points out that
this order will kill Berlin&#8217;s tourist traffic, &ldquo;as the night life of the
city is the only attraction for visitors.&rdquo; This implication that a
certain exalted personage is not among the local attractions seems to us
to amount almost to <i>lèse-majesté</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>When Lieutenant <span class="sc">Porte</span>&#8217;s water-plane, &ldquo;The America,&rdquo; refused to rise, he
should have tried changing its name to &ldquo;The South America.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Buckinghamshire Territorials, under their new commandant, Colonel
<span class="sc">Wethered</span>, are going in for chorus-singing practice. This is a good idea.
Sung badly enough, these choruses should prove a valuable weapon against
a musical foe, such as the Germans.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Owing to an outbreak of mumps at Harrow School the summer term has had
to close some days earlier than usual. It is characteristic of the
generous nature of the Harrow boys that, in spite of this annoying
interruption of their studies, there has been very little open
expression of resentment against those who introduced the ailment.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Coventry&#8217;s annual Lady Godiva procession took place last week, and was a
success. It is feared, however, that with the advance of fashion the
principal character&mdash;who on this occasion was attired in pink fleshings
draped with white chiffon&mdash;will be voted overdressed and so fail to
attract.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>&ldquo;To be well booted,&rdquo; says <i>The Times</i>, &ldquo;is to feel well dressed, at the
top of one&#8217;s power and joy.&rdquo; A small boy, however, who was well booted
by a larger boy the other day admits that he received a good dressing,
but holds that, apart from this, <i>The Times</i> was misinformed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The announcement that in the course of excavations on the site of the
old General Post Office in St. Martin&#8217;s-le-Grand, some old Roman tile
stamps have been discovered, has caused, we hear, a profound sensation
in philatelic circles.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Exceptionally rough weather is reported from the Bay of Biscay, and it
is said that on a certain passenger vessel even the valet of a
well-known nobleman was ill, <i>although he was an old retainer.</i></p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>&ldquo;Fishing with rod and line from a boat in the Downs at Deal,&rdquo; says <i>The
Daily Mail</i>, &ldquo;Lord <span class="sc">Herschell</span> and a friend caught 600 fish on Sunday. The
fish, mostly pouting, were hauled in three and four at a time.&rdquo; We
suspect they were pouting to show their annoyance at having their
Sabbath rest disturbed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is proposed in an L.C.C. report that barges should be used as
open-air schools on the river. Schools of language, presumably.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We are asked to deny that the fire which broke out at the bookstall at
the Hampstead station of the North London Railway last week was produced
spontaneously by a copy of one of <span class="sc">Miss Victoria Cross</span>&#8217;s novels.</p>

<h3>The Best Holiday Insurance.</h3>

<p><i>Mr. Punch</i> ventures to hint to the gentlest among his readers that,
while there are excellent methods of insuring against the disturbance of
their holidays by accident or bad weather, the best way for them to
insure happiness is to offer a share of it to those who cannot afford a
holiday of their own. The very easy sum of <span class="sc">Ten Shillings</span> means a
Fortnight among green fields or by the sea for one poor child, if the
gift is sent&mdash;and now is the moment&mdash;to the Earl of <span class="sc">Arran</span>, Hon.
Treasurer of the Children&#8217;s Country Holiday Fund, 18, Buckingham Street,
Strand, W.C.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE CRISIS.</h2>

<blockquote><p>
     [&ldquo;Lord Macaulay&#8217;s prose seems to be finding favour
     again.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Oshkosh Sentinel.</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<p>The place, too, was well fitted for such a gathering. Memories of
departed monarchs spoke from the rich hangings of the room in tones that
were not less eloquent for being silent. Here the <span class="sc">First Gentleman of
Europe</span> had displayed the rounded symmetry of those calves which had
defied the serried legions of the French and, in their lighter moments,
had captured the wayward fancies of the fair or mitigated the harshness
of a statesman. This was the chamber where the <span class="sc">Sailor King</span>, bluff but
not undignified, had jested with his intimates, had smoothed a frown
from the rugged brow of <span class="sc">Wellington</span> or held his own against the eagle
glance of <span class="sc">Grey</span>; the chamber where the great <span class="sc">Queen</span>, conscious of her
august destiny, had consecrated to grief such moments as could be spared
from the needs of Empire; the chamber where her son had laboured for
peace and extended the bounds of friendship; the chamber where a
<span class="sc">Disraeli</span>, repaying scorn with scorn, may have spread his snares, and a
<span class="sc">Gladstone</span>, overwhelmed by the torrent of his own eloquence, may have
fallen into them.</p>

<p>Nothing was wanting to complete the solemnity of the spectacle. Outside,
the scarlet-coated sentries paced rigidly on their accustomed rounds,
and the populace, hemmed in by the strong arms and the panting forms of
the constabulary, cheered to the echo its favourites or exchanged with
one another the harmless sallies that give pleasure to a crowd. Within,
the <span class="sc">King</span> himself, his face now clouded with anxious thought, now lit
with hope, gave a cordial welcome to the more unwonted of the guests he
had summoned to his presence, while busy courtiers filled the corridors
with an importance which lost nothing in weight from being unwarranted
by knowledge or experience. Lackeys in the gorgeous liveries of the most
brilliant Court in Europe were in attendance, ready to minister to those
whose failing strength might need refreshment, or to execute with
intelligence and despatch the humbler duties pertaining to their office.</p>

<p>Nor were the chiefs unworthy of the scene to which they had been called.
There was the Speaker, <span class="sc">Lowther</span>, his brow beaming with the good-humour
which enabled him to abate pomposity without injuring the feelings even
of the pompous, and to calm with a happy phrase the agitated waters of
debate. There were <span class="sc">Asquith</span>, strong in the affection of his friends, and
<span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>, braced to action by the invectives of his foes. There were
<span class="sc">Law</span> and <span class="sc">Lansdowne</span>, staunch defenders of the citadel in which the last of
the Tories, stern and unbending as ever, had sought refuge. Waterford
had sent <span class="sc">John Redmond</span>, the pride and champion of a nation, the unwearied
vindicator of Ireland&#8217;s right to govern herself. Through years of
contumely and depression he had borne aloft her standard, and now, when
her triumph was all but achieved, he was here to watch over a settlement
which all desired, though none hitherto had been able to bring it about.
With him had come <span class="sc">John Dillon</span>, tall, dignified and stately, whose grey
hair and admirable bearing had won the respect and conciliated the
temper of the most fastidious assembly in the world. Arrayed against
these two, sons of Ireland no less than they, were <span class="sc">Carson</span> and <span class="sc">Craig</span>;
<span class="sc">Carson</span> with his saturnine face and his swift and piercing intelligence,
<span class="sc">Craig</span> of the burly form and uncompliant humour. Vowed to the Orange
cause, and dwelling fondly on memories of the Boyne, they denounced with
equal severity the religion of Rome and the political aspirations of the
majority of their fellow-countrymen. Such were the men who were now met
to decide the most momentous issue of our time.</p>

<h2>MUTABILITY.</h2>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; I said, while the waiter was bringing the bill, &ldquo;where would
you like to go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t mind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What about a music-hall? I haven&#8217;t seen one
for twenty years. There&#8217;s a cinema about five miles from my place, but
it&#8217;s too dear. Only the millionaires can use it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we&#8217;ll go to a music-hall; but you&#8217;ll find
that they&#8217;ve changed a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t mind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so long as there&#8217;s something good. There&#8217;s so
much variety in a music-hall, one turn after another, don&#8217;t you know,
that you can&#8217;t go far wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My spirits sank. East Africa had kept his youth in camphor, and he had
no knowledge of the wonderful advances that we have been making. Turns
indeed!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll do the best I can for you,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll be
disappointed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he assured me stoutly, &ldquo;not in a music-hall. I&#8217;ve been wanting
to see one again for years. I suppose Jimmy Fawn isn&#8217;t still going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My spirits fell lower.</p>

<p>We went to one of the regular places, and, as I had feared, found a
revue in full blast. Topical talk, scenery and American songs
interminably. Every time a new person came on the stage my friend
eagerly perked up and lost his depression, hoping that at last it might
be one of his old delights&mdash;a juggler or knockabout or something like
that&mdash;but always he was disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, where are we?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;This isn&#8217;t a music-hall, is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the best,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>He looked round in dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where are the waiters?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not allowed among the audience any more,&rdquo; I told him; &ldquo;in fact, some
music-halls don&#8217;t even have licences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared at me in astonishment and sank into apathy. Coming up again he
said, &ldquo;Do you remember those two fellows with enormous stomachs and
hooked sticks? They were funny, if you like. Don&#8217;t you have that sort of
thing any more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember that act,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;I believe it was called the Risley
act&mdash;where a man lay on his back, with his legs up in the air, and flung
his family about with his feet? That was jolly clever. Don&#8217;t you have
that any more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Sisters something or other,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;dashed pretty girls, who
did everything at the same time&mdash;are they gone for ever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For ever,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And no comic songs either?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ve heard a lot of comic songs this evening,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, those,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t call those comic. They&#8217;re not comic
songs, they&#8217;re comic-opera songs. Don&#8217;t you have the others any more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at this kind of hall,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I daresay there may be a singer or
so left somewhere, with too big a coat and too small a hat, but not
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what are all the old performers doing?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe they&#8217;re starving,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<h2>THE PROGRESS OF MAN.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By our Anthropological Expert.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Professor Keith</span>, of the Royal College of Surgeons, reporting on the
skeleton of a prehistoric twelve-year-old boy recently discovered near
Ipswich, pronounces his stature to be much the same as the average
height of a modern boy of the same age, but the size of the head is
remarkably large. The professor states that he and his colleagues are
trying to get hold of people of every period, going as far back as they
can. They will then be able to differentiate the types that lived in any
period, and check the changes that came over them. So far, however,
there has been very little change.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking result of Professor <span class="sc">Keith</span>&#8217;s appeal so far has
come from the Isle of Man, where a magnificent three-legged skeleton has
been discovered in the Caves of Bradda. The remains have been pronounced
by Professor Quellin, the famous Manx anthropologist, to be those of a
man not less than 175 years of age, whose facial angle bears so marked a
resemblance to that of Mr. <span class="sc">Hall Caine</span> as to warrant the hypothesis that
he was one of the royal ancestors of the eminent novelist. Close to the
skeleton was a long bronze trumpet, from which Professor Quellin, after
several ineffectual efforts, ultimately succeeded in eliciting a deep
booming note. Mr. <span class="sc">Hall Caine</span>, who has taken the liveliest interest in
the discovery, is at present studying the instrument, and will, it is
hoped, give a recital shortly in the House of Keys.</p>

<p>The recent excavations at the famous Culbin Sands, undertaken by the
Forres Antiquarian Institute, have also resulted in some remarkable
finds. Prominent among these is a complete set of golf clubs belonging
to the Bronze period. In regard to length the clubs are very much the
same as the average implements used at the present day, but the large
size of the heads is remarkable, the niblick weighing nearly half a
hundredweight. It is plausibly inferred that clubs of this pattern may
also have been used as weapons, as the dwellers in this district in the
Bronze period are known to have been of a warlike and tumultuous
disposition. The game is believed to have been introduced by some
Maccabæan settlers, the ancestors of the clan of Macbeth, who flourished
in the vicinity.</p>

<p>In that fine spirit of enterprise which has always characterised <i>The
Daily Lyre</i>, the proprietors of that periodical have offered a prize of
£5,000 for the most characteristic relic of ancient and modern British
civilization, to be sent in by October 1. Already several notable
exhibits have been forwarded for the competition. Mr. Ronald McLurkin,
of Tain, has submitted portions of the boiler of an ancient locomotive,
apparently used on the Highland Railway in the time of the Boer War. Dr.
Edgar Hollam, of Brancaster, has sent a fine specimen of a fossilised
Norfolk biffin, and Miss Sheila Muldooney, of Skibbereen, a copy of <i>The
Skibbereen Eagle</i> containing the historic announcement that it had its
eye on the Tsar of <span class="sc">Russia</span>. Sir <span class="sc">George Alexander</span> sends a daguerreotype of
himself in knickerbockers with side whiskers and moustache, and Mr.
<span class="sc">Bernard Shaw</span> the first interview with himself that he ever wrote. It
appeared in <i>The Freeman&#8217;s Journal</i> in the &ldquo;seventies&rdquo; and is
illustrated with six portraits, in one of which Mr. <span class="sc">Shaw</span> appears in an
Eton suit and a tall hat, &ldquo;the only one I ever possessed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Henry Howarth</span> has forwarded a copy of <i>The Times</i> containing his
first contribution to that journal, a letter occupying a
column-and-a-half of small print, on the mammoth as a domestic pet in
the Court of the early Moghul Emperors. Mr. <span class="sc">Winston Churchill</span> competes
with an essay which he wrote, while a schoolboy at Harrow, on the
dangers of Democracy; and Master <span class="sc">Anthony Asquith</span> has sent the rough
notes of a Lecture on &ldquo;The Balliol Manner&rdquo; which he delivered many years
ago before a select audience at Claridge&#8217;s. The contrast in form and
thought between this crude essay and his recent lectures on the
mysticism of <span class="sc">Rabindranath Tagore</span> is quite amazing. We may also briefly
note the MS. version of an early sonnet by Mr. <span class="sc">Edmund Gosse</span>, addressed
to Sir <span class="sc">Sidney Lee</span>; several safety-pins and a sponge-bag which once
belonged to <span class="sc">Charlotte Brontë</span> and are now entered for the competition by
Mr. <span class="sc">Clement Shorter</span>; and a hot-water bottle used by <span class="sc">S. T. Coleridge</span> when
he was writing &ldquo;The Ancient Mariner,&rdquo; now in the possession of Sir
<span class="sc">Herbert Beerbohm Tree</span>.</p>

<p>The interesting point that emerges so far is that while little change is
observable in the physique, habits and manners of the British, as
illustrated by these relics, up to the last ten years or so, the
development in every direction, since the foundation of <i>The Daily
Lyre</i>, has been quite extraordinarily rapid and pronounced. For
instance, a cast of the head of a modern &ldquo;nut&rdquo; shows a compactness which
compares most favourably with the overgrown cranium of the prehistoric
boy reported on by Professor <span class="sc">Keith</span>.</p>

<h2>OUR COLOSSAL ARRANGEMENTS.</h2>

<p>One of the most appalling scandals of modern times is the disgraceful
suppression by the Ginger-beer Press of news relating to the state of
affairs in the Isle of Wight. For some weeks we have not flinched from
filling our columns with picturesque accounts of the epoch-making events
taking place there; and yet the Ginger-beer Press has cruelly put off
its readers with the scantiest details, or else refrained from any sort
of reference. We make our protest all the more vigorously because many
of those readers have been driven to read our own journal in preference
to the erroneous and misleading sheets to which we have referred.</p>

<p>This distressing state of things has forced us to make the fullest
arrangements for a constant stream of news to be supplied from our
branch offices at Ventnor, Totland Bay, the Needles, and other points of
the Island. We have despatched a huge staff of world-famous war
correspondents, descriptive writers, poets, photographers, Royal Academy
artists, gallopers, commissariat officers, and trained bloodhounds.
Field kitchens, field wireless equipment, and field glasses are included
among their impedimenta, and no single message will be printed in our
pages that has not been sent in some other way than through the ordinary
channels of the post, telephone and telegraph. Each member of this army
of artists, littérateurs and tacticians possesses a hip pocket, fully
loaded, two pairs of puttees, a compass and a wrist watch.</p>

<p>Every day scores of women and children are leaving the Isle of Wight for
the mainland. Gunboats and cruisers are passing and repassing before its
shores, by order of the Admiralty; strong, silent men are doggedly
pursuing the business they have in hand. In the very heart of the island
some of the flower of the youth of our country is being trained in the
art of naval warfare, while the thunders of gun-practice are heard every
hour around the coast. Yet, search where you will in the Ginger-beer
Press during the last few weeks, you will find practically no reference
to these things.</p>

<p>We implore our readers, on the highest patriotic grounds, to inform the
few remaining adherents of the Ginger-beer Press that if they desire the
Truth it can be found only in our pages.</p>

<p>We have the pleasure of printing below the first of the astonishing
articles which have been sent already from our Expeditionary Staff:&mdash;</p>

<h3>THE PRELIMINARY CALM.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>By Blinton X. Krapt.</i></p>

<p>The streets of Cowes are bathed in sunlight. Smart yachtsmen,
accompanied by daintily dressed ladies, walk hither and thither. The
shopkeepers chat pleasantly. The burly policeman drowsily pursues his
way. Children shout happily. Surely here is peace, says the unsuspecting
visitor.</p>

<p>A brown-faced man with a light beard and a heavy tread approached us.
&ldquo;It is all right,&rdquo; said my companion to him; &ldquo;this gentleman is a
friend.&rdquo; Then, lowering his voice, he added: &ldquo;<i>He came over last
night.</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;Beautiful place, Cowes, isn&#8217;t it?&rdquo; said the bronzed man. I
noticed that his hip pocket bulged. Yet none would have suspected that
his conversation was not of a perfectly ordinary character.</p>

<p>Entering the most sumptuous hotel in Cowes we had lunch. There was
nothing sinister about the place except that the waiters were German.
But I noted signs of understanding between them and my friend. &ldquo;I have
been here before,&rdquo; he explained, with a quick glance about him.</p>

<p>So life goes on from day to day. We are waiting, waiting. The little
boot-maker in his shop is waiting. The tailor is waiting. The hotel
staffs are waiting. The passengers on the railway platforms are waiting.
On the surface life is gay and free from care; but what I may have to
tell you when it comes round to my turn to write again, who can say?</p>

<h2>THE TOP SLICE.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<div class="address">
<p class="center">Letter from Mrs. Gregory-Browne to Mrs. Ribbanson-Smythe.</p>
<p>Upper Tooting,</p>
<p>21st July, 1914.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">My dearest Agatha</span>,&mdash;I must tell you about an extraordinary occurrence.
They were all quite respectable people, indeed most respectable. Perhaps
I ought not to include Mr. Jones. He is, you know (I mention this in the
strictest confidence, dearest), he is not&mdash;well, you know, he hardly
belongs to our set. I cannot understand why James is so absurdly fond of
him.</p>

<p>It was my At Home day last week and quite a lot of people, really nice
people too, came in spite of the heat. The heat may have had something
to do with it, but I really cannot think what it was.</p>

<p>I handed a plate of bread-and-butter to Miss Niccole. To my surprise she
hesitated a moment and then took the plate and handed it to me. When I
declined she offered it to Mrs. Fitzroy-Williams-Adamson. You know,
dear, she is fourth cousin to a baronet. Then the extraordinary thing
occurred. Mrs. Fitzroy-Williams-Adamson took the plate and offered it to
Miss Niccole. When Miss Niccole declined it she offered it to Mr.
Wildegoose (pronounced Wildergos, you know, dear). Then it was his turn.
And so it went on. Really, it was most extraordinary. Nothing like it
has ever been known in our family. I really cannot understand it.</p>

<p>Everybody passed the plate, and at last it came to Mr. Jones. He pointed
at the top piece of bread-and-butter. Yes, he actually pointed. He then
made the following extraordinary remark: &ldquo;I say, hasn&#8217;t this broken
loose from the bread-pudding, what, what?&rdquo; Thereupon he pushed it on one
side and took the next slice. I was ashamed and mortified for such a
thing to happen in my house. Really, it was most extraordinary.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen, the new curate, came in just then. He took the top slice, but
I caught him absent-mindedly putting it in a flower-pot. When he saw me
looking at him he blushed and started&mdash;started eating it, I mean.
However, he left most of it, and when everyone was gone I examined it.
It was perhaps a little hardened by the sun, but otherwise it was quite
a nice piece of bread-and-butter. I cannot understand it at all. The
whole thing was really most extraordinary ... most extraordinary.</p>

<p class="center">Your ever loving &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="sc">Sarah</span>.</p>

<div class="address">
<p class="center">Letter from Mrs. Ribbanson-Smythe to Mrs. Gregory-Browne.</p>
<p>Chiswick,</p>
<p>2nd July, 1914.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">My dearest Sarah</span>,&mdash;I have just read your most interesting letter, and I
quite agree that the whole occurrence was, as you say, most
extraordinary. I mentioned it to George. He says he has no doubt at all
that it was really a sound piece of bread-and-butter. I don&#8217;t know
whether the enclosed cutting will help you to understand, but I am
sending it. It is from last Saturday&#8217;s <i>Tooting Argus</i>. Somebody sent it
to George.</p>

<h4>GREAT NEW FEATURE.</h4>
<h5>PROBLEMS OF CONDUCT.</h5>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc">Conducted by Reginald Augustus
Plantagenet-Harris</span>.)</p>

<p><i>Problem 3.</i>&mdash;A. is paying a call. His hostess offers him
bread-and-butter. He notices that the top piece has suffered from the
heat. What should A. do?</p>

<p>Answer adjudged correct.&mdash;A. should politely take the plate from his
hostess, murmuring, &ldquo;May I offer it to you?&rdquo; If she refuses he should
offer it to his nearest neighbour. When the offending slice has been got
rid of in this way he can help himself to the next slice and then return
the plate to its owner.</p>

<p>Highly commended.&mdash;A. should explain to his hostess that he has a
peculiar hobby, to wit, collecting slices of bread-and-butter from the
houses of the great. His collection of Royal Family slices is
unrivalled. Might he have the pleasure and honour of adding to his
collection this dainty specimen? He should then reverently fold the
slice in two and place it in his breast-pocket.</p>

<p>[Our only objection to this is that it seems a rather greasy thing to do.]</p>

<p>Incorrect answers:&mdash;(1) A. should make a facetious remark, such as,
&ldquo;Hasn&#8217;t this escaped from the bread pudding?&rdquo; He should then playfully
but firmly push the slice aside and trust to luck on the next.</p>

<p>(2) A. must out of courtesy to his hostess accept thankfully whatever
she places before him. Any other course of conduct would be an affront.
It now however becomes his personal property and he can adopt whichever
of the following courses is most convenient&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Secrete it in a fancy flower-pot or in the gramophone.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) If the dog is a silent eater hold it behind his back so that the
dog may get it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Note</span>.&mdash;If the dog refuses to touch it, say loudly, &ldquo;I cannot understand
how any animal can decline such delightful bread-and-butter.&rdquo; He can
then openly dispose of it in the grate or the waste-paper-basket on the
ground that the dog&#8217;s nose has vitiated its freshness.</p>

<h2>THE YOUNG OF THE SEA-SERPENT.</h2>

<p>With the approach of the silly season one&#8217;s thoughts turn naturally to
the prospect of stealing into print and enjoying all the sweets of
authorship without the reception of a cheque to vulgarise them. An
infinite variety of topics, our representative gathered yesterday, is
now on the eve of discussion, and the quill that cannot find something
to say on at least one of them had better return to its native goose
without delay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother of Ten,&rdquo; we were informed by the courteous editor of <i>The
Halfpenny Bleater</i>, will as usual open that journal&#8217;s discussion, and
this year her thoughts have turned to bathing fatalities. &ldquo;Should Land
Crabs Learn Swimming&rdquo; is the subject which she (or, to betray an office
secret, he) has selected. Due emphasis on the necessity for university
costume in the case of an affirmative reply to the question will be laid
by &ldquo;Paterfamilias,&rdquo; who will contribute the second letter of the series.</p>

<p><i>The Morning Dip</i> will maintain its reputation for intellectuality with
a spiritual discussion on &ldquo;Has Life a Double Meaning?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Is Existence
a Joke?&rdquo;&mdash;the exact title has not yet been decided. &ldquo;Constant Reader&rdquo;
has already bought a penny packet of assorted stationery and charged it
to the office petty cash, and only a really good murder can prevent the
early appearance of his letter. As readers will remember, correct
spelling is a feature of this author&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>In pursuance of its settled policy <i>The Daily Giggle</i> will appeal more
especially to the fair sex. There is more than a touch of pathos in the
signature &ldquo;Orphan Boy,&rdquo; which will appear at the foot of his letter on
the subject, &ldquo;Are First Cousins Kissable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the most vital question of all will be raised in <i>The
Daily Jingo</i>, where &ldquo;Pro Bono Publico&rdquo; will lay down his views on &ldquo;Our
Softening Sinews.&rdquo; In his well-known style, which is so happy a blend of
public spirit and split infinitives, he will plead for less indulgence
in our dealings with the young. &ldquo;We are,&rdquo; he says in his peroration,
which we were privileged to see, &ldquo;raising up a soft breed, and we shall
live to bitterly rue it. The future of the race is, of course, on the
knees of the gods, but let us determine to also lay it across the knee
of parent and schoolmaster. So shall the rising generation learn the
merits of the strong right arm that has made England what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In conjunction with <i>The Perfect Little Lady</i>, which will discuss &ldquo;The
Highest Type of Man,&rdquo; the editor of <i>The Brain Pan</i> will throw open his
columns to all those with views on &ldquo;The Most Attractive Girl.&rdquo; For the
start he has secured the services of &ldquo;Virile Englishman,&rdquo; who will put
aside her knitting to take up the pen in obedience to his commands. <i>The
Perfect Little Lady</i>&#8217;s first letter will be contributed by &ldquo;Sweet
Seventeen,&rdquo; who has studied her subject by diligent attendance at all
the best boxing matches of the current year.</p>

<span class="sc">William O&#8217;Brien</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">Winston Churchill</span>.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, July 20.</i>&mdash;The T. R. Westminster is at least
equal to the old T. R. Drury Lane in capacity for producing dramatic
turns. When Members went off on Saturday for week-end holiday the Ulster
attitude was pretty generally understood. Ulster demanded &ldquo;a clean cut,&rdquo;
with the alternative, phrased by <span class="sc">Carson</span>, of &ldquo;Come over and fight us.&rdquo;
The Cabinet after prolonged deliberation had resolved to meet demand
with firm <i>non possumus</i>: <span class="sc">Premier</span> was expected on resumption of Sittings
this afternoon to announce conclusion of matter, adding such offer of
concession on matter of detail as, whilst providing golden bridge for
Opposition, would avert revolt in his own camp, where &ldquo;conversations&rdquo;
with leaders of Opposition are regarded with growing jealousy and
suspicion.</p>

<p>New stage in long-drawn-out controversy sufficient to create profoundest
interest in to-day&#8217;s proceedings. It would surely be the beginning of
the end. What exactly the <span class="sc">Premier</span> would say about further concession to
Ulster, and how the overtures would be received on Front Opposition
Bench, were questions on which might hang the issue of peace or war.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Premier</span> had a more startling message to deliver. From point of view of
dramatic effect it was a thousand pities his secret had been prematurely
disclosed. When he rose amid profound stillness of crowded House
everyone knew what he was going to say. In ordinary circumstances his
interposition at so critical a juncture would have been hailed by
resounding applause from the multiform sections that contribute to
making up of Ministerial majority. As matters turned out, a frigid cheer
greeted his appearance at the Table. To the announcement that &ldquo;in view
of the grave situation the <span class="sc">King</span> has thought it right to summon
representatives of Parties, both British and Irish, to a Conference in
Buckingham Palace, with the object of discussing outstanding issues in
relation to the problem of Irish government,&rdquo; he had only one new thing
to add. It was that the <span class="sc">Speaker</span> would preside over the Conference.</p>

<p>This was the only passage in the brief formal conversation, to which
<span class="sc">Leader of Opposition</span> and <span class="sc">Leader of Irish Nationalists</span> contributed, that
elicited general cheer. A high tribute to occupant of the Chair.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ginnell</span> saw his opportunity and seized it by the hair. He is one of
three leaders of the Irish Nationalists. Understood that his Party
consists of a single member, so shadowy that there are varied reports as
to his identity. Member for N.W. Meath leaped on to pinnacle of enduring
fame when the present Parliament met to elect a Speaker. Before Mr.
<span class="sc">Lowther</span> was qualified to take the Chair, and whilst as yet no recognised
authority existed, <span class="sc">Ginnell</span>, master of the situation, delivered a long
harangue. Proposed now to offer a few remarks &ldquo;as an independent Irish
Nationalist.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Speaker</span> on point of order restricting him to putting a question, he
&ldquo;begged to ask the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> what precedent he had and what
authority to advise the <span class="sc">King</span> to place himself at the head of a
conspiracy to defeat the decision of this House?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Members desiring to take their seats will please come to the Table,&rdquo;
said the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>.</p>

<p>The observation did not appear relevant. It met the occasion. It brought
up <span class="sc">Leverton Harris</span>, newly elected for East Worcestershire, who found his
welcome the warmer by reason of the fact that he had been a passive
instrument in avoiding what might under less adroit management have
developed into a disorderly scene.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Premier</span> announces Conference upon Ulster question to
meet at Buckingham Palace on the invitation of <span class="sc">His Majesty</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span></p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Dull sitting closed in lively conversation arising on motion
for adjournment. <span class="sc">Rupert Gwynne</span>, jealous for due observance of traditions
of House, has noticed with concern the departure for Canada for
indefinite period of Member for East St. Pancras. At Question time asked
<span class="sc">Chancellor of Exchequer</span> whether Mr. <span class="sc">Martin</span> had applied for Chiltern
Hundreds. Answered in the negative, he put a further question to
<span class="sc">Premier</span>, directing his attention to Act of 6 <span class="sc">Henry VIII.</span> c. 16, ordering
that no Member of Parliament shall absent himself from attendance except
he have licence of Mr. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>. This upon pain of having his wages
docked. <span class="sc">Premier</span> brushed him aside with one of his brief answers.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gwynne</span> not the man to be shouldered off the path of duty when it lies
straight before him. Here was a Member in receipt of £400 a year leaving
the place of business where it was assumed to be earned, not even taking
the trouble to follow example of the clerk who, left in sole charge of
his master&#8217;s office, wrote in legible hand, &ldquo;Back D&#8217;reckly,&rdquo; affixed
notice to front door and went forth to enjoyment of prolonged meal.</p>

<p>Since he could get no satisfaction at Question time he kept Members in,
after hour of adjournment, in order to debate subject.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it turned out that he was not exactly the man to have
undertaken the job. Amid laughter and hilarious cheering <span class="sc">Home Secretary</span>
pointed out that here was a case of Satan reproving sin. Reference to
the records showed that during the time payment of Members has been in
vogue, of 687 divisions <span class="sc">Gwynne</span> was absent from 424. (<span class="sc">Gwynne</span> later
corrected these figures.) During that time he had drawn from the
Exchequer salary amounting to £1,000.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On his own principle, that payment should be in proportion to
attendance, the hon. Member,&rdquo; said the <span class="sc">Home Secretary</span>, &ldquo;is entitled to
only £400. Being so conscientious no doubt he will repay to the
<span class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span> the balance of £600.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Helmsley</span>, gallantly coming to assistance of friend in dire straits,
himself fell into the bog. It appeared that of 1056 divisions taken in
two Sessions he had been absent from 602. Here was another unexpected
little windfall for the Exchequer.</p>

<p>At this stage it was found expedient to drop the subject; adjournment
not further resisted.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget Bill dealt with on Report stage.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;With that austerity that since Stuart times has marked
relations of House of Commons with royalty Mr. <span class="sc">Hogge</span> is known at
Westminster simply as the Member for East Edinburgh, a position he with
characteristic modesty accepts. But blood, especially royal blood, like
murder, will out. Lineal descendant of one of the oldest dynasties in
the world&#8217;s history, Mr. <span class="sc">Hogge</span> cannot be expected always and altogether
to be free from ancestral influence. Something of the hauteur of <span class="sc">&#8217;ogge</span>,
King of Bashan (or, as some records have it, <span class="sc">og</span>) is discerned in his
attitude and manner when, throned on corner seat below Gangway, he
occasionally deigns to direct the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> in the way he should
go.</p>

<p>Such opportunity presented itself in connection with meeting of
Conference which through the Parliamentary week has centred upon
Buckingham Palace the attention of mankind. With respect to palaces Mr.
<span class="sc">Hogge</span> is by family association an expert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why Rookery?&rdquo; <i>Miss Betsey Trotwood</i> sharply asked <i>David Copperfield</i>
when he casually mentioned his mother&#8217;s postal address.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why Buckingham Palace?&rdquo; asked Mr. <span class="sc">Hogge</span>, bending severe glance on
Treasury Bench whence the <span class="sc">Premier</span> had judiciously fled.</p>

<p>St. Stephen&#8217;s, which houses the Member for East Edinburgh, is also a
royal palace. Why then was not the Conference held within its walls,
instead of under the roof of what he loftily alluded to as &ldquo;the domestic
Palace&rdquo;?</p>

<p>This and much more, with covert references to machinations of the two
Front Benches, Mr. <span class="sc">Hogge</span> wanted to know.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>, uneasily conscious of the coming storm, had, as
mentioned, discreetly disappeared. As an offering to righteous
indignation he left behind him on the Treasury Bench the body of
<span class="sc">Attorney-General</span>. That astute statesman avoided difficulty and personal
disaster by meekly undertaking to lay before the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> the
views so eloquently and pointedly set forth by the hon. Member.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Hogge</span> graciously assented to this course, and what at the outset
looked like threatening incident terminated.</p>

<h2>THE GESTICULATORS.</h2>

<p>The supper-room was so full that I quite expected to find that, since I
was so late, the harassed head-waiter had taken the liberty of presuming
my death and letting someone else have my table; but there it was, empty
and ready for me. I sank into a chair with a feeling of relief and,
having ordered something to eat, began to examine the room. There was
not a spare place; everyone was eating and talking and unusual
excitement was in the air. From my remote corner I could not catch any
words, but the odd thing was that at every table one at least of the
men, who were all in evening-dress, was waving his arms. Now and then a
man would stand up to do this better. It was as though they were all
deaf and dumb, or cinema actors.</p>

<p>The next day at lunch I had a similar experience. I patronized another
restaurant, which seemed to be equally popular, and again every man was
gesticulating in a style totally foreign to the staid apathetic
Londoner. What could it mean? What was the reason?</p>

<p>I asked the waiter. He laughed. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have notice it too. It
is funny, is it not? Zey all show each other how <span class="sc">Carpentier</span> won on ze

<h2>AN ERROR IN ARCADY.</h2>

<p>People who know us both have often expressed a doubt as to whether
Charles or myself is the more absent-minded and unobservant. I wish to
set the matter at rest once and for all.</p>

<p>We were discussing William&#8217;s wedding, which had just taken place,
romantically enough, in the very heart of Herts&mdash;one of those quaint
little villages where no sound seems to disturb the silence of the long
summer day but the gentle bleating of horn to horn and the murmur of
innumerable tyres. Both of us had been there, and Charles came round to
talk to me about it a few evenings afterwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do hope the poor dear fellow will be happy,&rdquo; he said, lighting his
fifth match and pulling away vigorously at an ugly-looking briar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It really goes much better with tobacco in it,&rdquo; I said, passing him my
pouch. &ldquo;Why on earth shouldn&#8217;t William be happy? It seemed a very pretty
wedding. Did you notice how the rays of the sun coming through the
window lit up the best man&#8217;s boots?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay, I daresay,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;As a matter of fact I couldn&#8217;t see
the church part of it very well: I came late and was behind a pillar at
the back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it all went beautifully,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;Everybody stood up and sat
down in the wrong places as usual, and the friends of the bride looked
with extreme <i>hauteur</i> at the friends of the bridegroom, and <i>vice
versâ</i>. I suppose you went to the reception afterwards. I never saw you
at all except for a moment on the platform going back. You must have
shaken hands with the happy pair and examined the presents?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went to the house,&rdquo; said Charles. &ldquo;I went in a motor-car on a seat
that took two men to hold down, and that hit me hard when I tried to
stand up. I caught a glimpse of William, but I couldn&#8217;t find the room
where the presents were set out, so I went through almost at once into
the garden, where the feasting was going on. Do tell me about the gifts.
Was my little pepper-castor hung on the line?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&#8217;t notice that,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but my butter-dish was doing itself
proud. It had sneaked up to a magnificent toast-rack with stabling
accommodation for about eight pieces, given by somebody with a title.
And you ought to have seen the fish-slices. The fish-slices wore
gorgeous. I expect William will spend a great part of his married life
in slicing fish. It will be a great change from golf-balls. But I think
you really ought to have said a few hearty and well-chosen words to the
young people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s just it,&rdquo; replied Charles in a mournful voice. &ldquo;I did. I talked
to the bride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it, so did I!&rdquo; I exclaimed rather indignantly. &ldquo;Directly I got in
I went up to William and her and said to her, &lsquo;How glad you must be it&#8217;s
all over!&rsquo; and then quite suddenly it struck me that that wasn&#8217;t really
the best thing to say in the circumstances, so I blushed and trod on
William&#8217;s toe and passed on. What did you do in the garden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wandered about on the lawn where there were lots and lots of
people,&rdquo; said Charles. &ldquo;I didn&#8217;t seem to meet anyone I knew, but the
flower-beds were most beautifully kept. I have seldom seen such a
display of cress sandwiches and champagne. After a bit I strolled down
through the shrubberies, went through a little wooden gate and found
myself amongst the raspberry canes. About a quarter of an hour later,
after a little fruity refreshment, whom should I meet walking along a
quiet shady path but the bride herself, all alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stealing away to get one last raspberry at the dear old home,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;How romantic! What did you do? Hide?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Charles bitterly. &ldquo;I only wish I had. I felt that now or
never was the time. I went straight up to her, and, feeling that to talk
about the weather or the theatres on such an occasion would be rather
footling, in spite of the fact that we&#8217;d never been introduced, I
plunged straight into it. &lsquo;You&#8217;ve never seen me before in your life,&rsquo; I
said earnestly, &lsquo;because you haven&#8217;t got eyes in the back of your head,
and I&#8217;ve never seen you because I can&#8217;t look through stone. What&#8217;s more,
I&#8217;m only a little silver pepper-castor, an insignificant item in your
cruet. But I must tell you how delighted I am to have a chance of
speaking to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did she say to that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&#8217;d never believe it, but the girl looked quite nervous and
frightened, and positively began to walk away from me. I supposed I&#8217;d
begun on the wrong tack, so I hurried after her and started again.
&lsquo;Marriage is a state full of the most serious responsibilities,&rsquo; I said,
&lsquo;but one glance at you shows me that you are fully competent to shoulder
them all.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds as if you thought she looked a trifle statuesque,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Did she seem annoyed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse,&rdquo; replied Charles. &ldquo;She hurried on again without speaking a word.
&lsquo;Stop,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;stop! I am a friend of the fairy prince;&rsquo; and just
then we came out on to a piece of lawn, and she gave a little shriek and
actually ran away, leaving me standing where I was. I was so ashamed and
exhausted that I slunk back through the little gate and had some more
raspberries. When I had partially recovered I returned to the upper part
of the garden again, had two cups of tea in the big tent, and made my
way back to the station, where I saw you. If you hadn&#8217;t got into another
carriage I should have told you about it at the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you never saw them going away at all?&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Charles; &ldquo;did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I not?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You wouldn&#8217;t believe the amount of rice I started
their married life with. About two milk puddings&#8217; worth, I should say.
And so you are not quite satisfied with William&#8217;s choice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she seems to me to be rather an unresponsive and timid sort of
person,&rdquo; said Charles. &ldquo;Not tactful, nor likely to make what the
newspapers call a charming hostess. I should have liked dear William to
marry someone who would be a social success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I smoked for some time in silence, and then I had an idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was the bride dressed when you saw her, Charles?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I know how women are dressed? She was in white, of course, and
hadn&#8217;t a hat on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she had a train and a veil, I suppose. She hadn&#8217;t a short skirt by
any chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness, how do I know?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I didn&#8217;t notice all that. Why do
you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you only saw her once, you see,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and you went through
that little gate at the bottom of the garden, didn&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Charles. &ldquo;What&#8217;s that got to do with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing. Only I know that there were some people playing
tennis at the next house, and very likely the two gardens are connected,
and I&#8217;m wondering whether that girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens,&rdquo; said Charles.... &ldquo;You haven&#8217;t got such a thing as a
hairpin about you, have you? This pipe&#8217;s stopped up.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>ALL LIARS&#8217; DAY.</h2>

<p>&ldquo;So it&#8217;s &mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s birthday to-day,&rdquo; said Fortescue (naming a very
well-known politician) as he looked up from his newspaper. &ldquo;You&#8217;ll call
and wish him many happy returns, of course, Ferguson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We who travel up together each morning by this train are pretty well
agreed about &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t mention that man to me!&rdquo; cried Ferguson. &ldquo;He&#8217;s absolutely the
biggest liar on earth. I can&#8217;t imagine how he faces the world as he does
after having been exposed so many times. You&#8217;d think he would want to
crawl away into a hole somewhere. He can&#8217;t have the least sense of
shame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; interrupted the burly stranger seated in the corner.
&ldquo;Pardon me; there is reason why he should. It is not <i>his</i> fault if he
is addicted to inexactitude. He was predestined to it. It is the
irresistible influence of the day on which he was born. Every man born
on this day must inevitably grow up to be a liar; it is his fate, from
which there can be no escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; protested Ferguson. &ldquo;That sounds rather far-fetched, you
know, for these days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Sir,&rdquo; retorted the other, brushing up his moustache
aggressively and glaring at Ferguson, &ldquo;I happen to be President of the
Society for the Investigation of Natal Day Influences upon Character, so
I presume I may claim to know what I am talking about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So truculent was his demeanour that nobody ventured to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Society,&rdquo; he continued after a pause, &ldquo;has conducted its researches
over a period of many years. I am going to give you just a few examples
out of thousands we have collected. Let us take a significant date,
February 29th. A man born on that day is a coward. It is inevitable.
Pusillanimity is born in him and can never be eradicated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had before us a month or two ago the case of a gentleman living in a
country town&mdash;a quiet, shy, studious recluse&mdash;born on this fatal day. By
some mischance he happened to pick up a journal in which was an article
on the Government by Mr. <span class="sc">Arnold White</span>. He read it. He was so terrified
that he expired from heart failure. That sounds to you incredible, but
real life is often incredible. That is one of the discoveries of our
Society.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give you a more remarkable instance still. A well-to-do
gentleman with the same birthday, whose case we have recorded in our
journals, is now, though perfectly healthy, bed-ridden under the
following amazing circumstances. He accidentally discovered that his
tailor, who had clothed him since boyhood, was an anarchist. After this
he was afraid to have any further dealings with the man, while, on the
other hand, he lacked sufficient courage to face the ordeal of being
fitted by a fresh tailor. For some time he used to sit up at night and
secretly sew patches into his trousers. Naturally this could not go on
for ever, and at last, when his garments were dropping to pieces, he had
to take to his bed.... You smile, Sir. Perhaps you think I am
exaggerating?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes flashed and his voice vibrated with such anger that I jumped
six inches out of my seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all&mdash;not at all,&rdquo; I stammered. &ldquo;Only it occurred to me&mdash;er&mdash;that
he might have&mdash;er&mdash;b-bought them ready-made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your knowledge of human nature must be singularly slight,&rdquo; replied the
other icily, &ldquo;if you imagine that a man without sufficient courage to be
fitted by a tailor would be brave enough to wear ready-made clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me, Sir,&rdquo; said Dean, coming to the rescue, &ldquo;that your two
instances prove little, if anything. They may be mere coincidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger leaned forward, frowned heavily and wagged his forefinger
at Dean, who wilted visibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Society for the Investigation of Natal Day Influences upon
Character,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;does not seek to build up a theory upon isolated
and arbitrarily selected examples. We deal with the subject
scientifically. To continue with this date, February 29th. After several
cases similar to those I have recounted had come to our notice, we made
out a list of two hundred and fifty men born on this day. To each of
them we sent a representative to ask for a subscription to the Society.
Though they had never heard of it before, <i>every one of those two
hundred and fifty was easily intimidated into subscribing.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let us consider another date&mdash;March 3rd. Several striking instances
had led us to suspect that a person born on March 3rd comes into the
world with an ineradicable passion for gambling. I will give you just
one of these. A gentleman one day imagined he was seriously ill and
called in a doctor. The latter laughed at his fears and offered to bet
him that he would live to be seventy. The temptation was too great. The
gambler closed with the offer, and on the eve of his seventieth birthday
drowned himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point Empson sniggered audibly. The speaker turned his head and
fixed his terrifying glance upon the delinquent. Poor Empson grew very
red, and endeavoured to cover his lapse by coughing noisily. The other
waited patiently till he had finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you wish to say something, Sir,&rdquo; he remarked coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; said Empson. &ldquo;Most interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The President made a gesture which indicated that Empson was beneath
contempt and renewed his discourse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Continuing the same method of research,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we compiled a list
of nearly four hundred persons born on March 3rd. To each of these we
sent particulars of a Derby Sweepstake. <i>Every one of them, gentlemen,
applied for a ticket by return of post.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an impressive pause. The President looked round the carriage
defiantly as if challenging suspicion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of our tests with regard to to-day&#8217;s date&mdash;liars&#8217; day,&rdquo; he
continued presently, &ldquo;was rather amusing. We hired a room in the City
for a week and sent out over three hundred letters to persons born on
that day. Our notepaper was headed, &lsquo;Short, Stay and Hoppett,
Solicitors,&rsquo; and the letters were in identical terms. They said that we
had been endeavouring for some time to trace the relatives of one Davy
Jones, who, after acquiring a large fortune in Australia, had died
intestate, and we had that morning been given to understand that the
gentleman with whom we wore corresponding was a nephew of the deceased,
etc., etc. You guess what happened. <i>Every one of them without exception
claimed as his uncle this millionaire who never existed.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The train began to slow down, and the President rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I get out here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&#8217;m sorry. I should like to have discussed
the subject further. You, Sir&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed threateningly at
Ferguson&mdash;&ldquo;will doubtless in future refrain from blaming Mr. &mdash;&mdash; for a
failing for which, as you see, he is in no way responsible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ferguson quaked and said nothing.</p>

<p>The President brushed up his moustache still higher and looked round in
triumph. All of us were completely cowed&mdash;all of us, except little
Windsor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, Sir,&rdquo; said the latter gently. &ldquo;Before you leave us will
you kindly accept this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took out his tie-pin and laid it in the other&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>For the first time the burly one&#8217;s confidence deserted him. He reddened
slightly and looked embarrassed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s very kind of you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but really I&mdash;I don&#8217;t quite
understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a birthday present for you,&rdquo; said Windsor sweetly.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>(<i>By Mr. Punch&#8217;s Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>Three numbers of <i>The South Polar Times</i> were brought out at Cape Evans,
the winter quarters of Captain <span class="sc">Scott</span>, during 1911. Mr. <span class="sc">Apsley
Cherry-Garrard</span>, the editor, has now presented them to a wider circle
under the auspices of <span class="sc">Smith, Elder</span>, hoping that they will prove &ldquo;a
source of interest and pleasure to the friends of the expedition.&rdquo; He
need have no fears. Of course a paper produced under such conditions is
in its nature esoteric, and many of its jokes are lost if you &ldquo;don&#8217;t
know Jimson.&rdquo; But if you have previously read <i>Scott&#8217;s Last Expedition</i>
then you <i>will</i> &ldquo;know Jimson&rdquo;; you will feel that every man at Cape
Evans in 1911 was a personal friend of yours, and you will be delighted
with this facsimile reproduction of the paper which delighted them.
Personally I cannot read or see too much of the men who are my heroes;
and in a world where an ordinary school-girl is allowed twenty-seven
photographs of Mr. <span class="sc">Lewis Waller</span> I shall not consider myself surfeited
with two caricatures and a humorous character-sketch of Lieutenant
<span class="sc">Bowers</span>. But there are contributions to <i>The South Polar Times</i> which
have an interest other than the merely personal. Mr. <span class="sc">Griffith Taylor</span>, a
tower of strength on the literary side, is really funny in <i>The
Bipes</i>&mdash;a paper (on the wingless bipeds of Cape Evans) supposed to have
been read by <span class="sc">Oates&#8217;</span> escaped rabbit to the Royal Society of Rabbits. Mr.
<span class="sc">Taylor</span>, as a recorder of history in <i>Scott&#8217;s Last Expedition</i>, was, I
thought, a little too familiar; in these and other articles he is much
more at home. But it is upon Dr. <span class="sc">Wilson</span>&#8217;s pictures (both serious and
comic) that <i>The South Polar Times</i> can most justly pride itself. I envy
Mr. <span class="sc">Cherry-Garrard</span> so prolific and brilliant a contributor. Still more I
envy him (and all his colleagues at Cape Evans) the knowledge of such a
man. The more I get to know of <span class="sc">&ldquo;Bill&rdquo; Wilson</span>, the more I understand that
he was of the very salt of the earth&mdash;a man to love whom was indeed a
liberal education, and to be loved by whom was a passport to the little
company of the elect.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>When <i>John Barleycorn</i> (<span class="sc">Mills and Boon</span>) came my way, I noticed that the
publishers had shown a reticence, unusual in these days, on the outside
paper cover; they didn&#8217;t say a word as to the quality or character of
the contents. They had three good reasons: first, given the name of <span class="sc">Jack
London</span>, there was no need of further advertisement or lure; second, if
they had started describing the book they would have been unable to say
with strict truth that it was or was not a novel, for it isn&#8217;t and it
is; third, and best, they couldn&#8217;t, as honest men, have avoided
mentioning that it is in a way a sermon on alcoholism, and that, being
said, might have acted as a deterrent, unless they had explained (as
they wouldn&#8217;t have had room to do) how and why, when they said &ldquo;sermon,&rdquo;
they didn&#8217;t really mean &ldquo;sermon.&rdquo; So they lay low and said nothing, and
I almost wish I had done the same, for no one who has the lightest
interest, practical or theoretical, in John Barleycorn ought to be put
off these alcoholic memoirs. The diarist purports to have been first
drunk at the age of five, again at the age of seven, almost perpetually
for a spell of years from the age of fifteen, and yet to have taken over
a quarter of a century to acquire a liking for alcohol. That sounds odd,
but is not unique. Not only in California and not only in the lower
grades of society, is Youth, vigorous and unspoilt, bound to acquire the
taste if it would foregather on lively and intimate terms with its
fellows; and not only in the saloons of the Oakland water-front are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span>
fine youngsters drinking themselves permanently silly because it is
their only way of being men among men, jolly good fellows among jolly
good fellows. A sound enough text for any sermon; and, I may honestly
add, a sound enough sermon for any text, with a strong smell of the sea
and of adventure about it. But I ask myself for what purpose the
photograph of Mr. and Mrs. <span class="sc">Jack London</span> is inserted as a frontispiece? As
well, I think, have had a portrait of Mr. <span class="sc">Mills</span>, with Mr. <span class="sc">Boon</span> inset.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Isn&#8217;t <i>The Youngest World</i> (<span class="sc">Bell</span>) an engaging title for a book? It
caught my interest at once. I am not altogether sure that the story
itself is as good as its name, but that still leaves a margin of
quality, and I for one have enjoyed it greatly&mdash;in patches. Let Mr.
<span class="sc">Robert Dunn</span> not too hastily condemn me if I say that he has written a
fatiguing tale. Partly I mean this as a high compliment. The
descriptions of hardships borne and physical difficulties overcome by
his hero are so vivid that they convey a sensation of actual bodily
strain in a manner that only one other living writer can equal. There
are chapters in the book that leave one aching all over. So long, in
fact, as Mr. <span class="sc">Dunn</span>&#8217;s characters are content to do things, to climb
mountains, to ford rivers, to endure hunger and cold and weariness, I am
in close bodily sympathy with them; it is when they begin to talk and to
explain their mental states that my keenness is threatened by another
and less pleasing fatigue. It is not that the scope of the story&mdash;a
man&#8217;s regeneration by love and hardship&mdash;isn&#8217;t a good one: quite the
contrary. It is that I simply do not believe that human beings,
especially those that figure in this book, would ever talk about
themselves in this particular way. &ldquo;In the name of our own blood,&rdquo; she
uttered softly, &ldquo;of Love, the Future, and Victory....&rdquo; That is a random
sentence from the last page, and very typical of Mr. <span class="sc">Dunn</span>&#8217;s dialogue. It
is full of gracious qualities, thoughtful, and throughout on a high
literary level, but as a realistic transcription of frontier talk it
leaves me incredulous. Still the setting, I repeat, is quite wonderful.
You shall read the chapters that tell of <i>Gail&#8217;s</i> ascent of Mount
Lincoln, and see if they don&#8217;t stir your blood, especially where he
reaches the top, alone (and therefore unable to talk), and sees the
world at his feet. You will exult in this.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Victor Bridges</span> has a very versatile pen and in most of the
twenty-one pieces of <i>Jetsam</i> (<span class="sc">Mills and Boon</span>) which he has recovered
from the waves of monthly magazines and elsewhere there is a certain
amount of material for mirth. I do not however find him a startlingly
original humorist, whether on the river Thames, where he seems to follow
in the wake of Mr. <span class="sc">Jerome K. Jerome</span>, or in a Chelsea &ldquo;pub,&rdquo; where his
manners are reminiscent of the characters of Messrs. <span class="sc">W. W. Jacobs</span> and
<span class="sc">Morton Howard</span>. Again, in the story called &ldquo;The First Marathon&rdquo; (where,
by the way, he states that &ldquo;It is true that the word &lsquo;Marathon&rsquo; was
first used in connection with the old Olympian games,&rdquo; which seems a
little unfair to <span class="sc">Miltiades</span>), the fun mainly depends on the use of such
phrases as &ldquo;Spoo-fer,&rdquo; &ldquo;King Kod,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Can&#8217;t-stik-you-shun-all
Club.&rdquo; Other stories are of the adventurous or romantic type sacred to
serial fiction, no fewer than three dealing with escaped convicts on
Dartmoor, and one (the first in the book) describing the chance meeting
of a man and a pretty girl on an uninhabited island off the West Coast
of Scotland. Here, for some reason or other, the man insisted on calling
his charming and unknown companion <i>Astarte</i>, a name which, if I had
been in her place, I should have been inclined to resent. But Mr.
<span class="sc">Bridges&#8217;</span> dialogue is nearly always bright, and his knowledge of the
machinery of yarn-spinning excellent. There is just one other point
however which I should like to mention. The book includes a brand-new
Russian wolf-story, in which the heroes protect themselves from the
bites of these ferocious quadrupeds by putting on armour, which they
find in a deserted house. I don&#8217;t object to that; but, when they leave
the railway line along which they have been travelling and plunge into a
forest-path they come to a place where the route forks and cannot make
out which of the two roads will be more likely to lead them back to the
railway. I do not feel that these men were the sort of people to be
trusted to wander by themselves in a desolate Siberian anecdote.</p>
